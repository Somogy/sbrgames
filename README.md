Games codes in C# with Unity Engine

This repertoire consists of a few individual codes used in various GameObjects, whether they are playable, interactive, UI or mechanical elements, all from games that I have developed, still developing, test versions or Gamejams that I participate.

SUMMARY

-ControllableMechanicalElevator.cs: Is a script for an elevator in one of my games

-FadeScreen.cs: Fade the screen game to black or from black in scenes transitions

-FloorButtons.cs: Is a button in the ground, activated by or walking on or throwing heavy objects, thereby activating a second object

-LumberjacksChamber.zip: A fighting game for Windows (this zip loaded) and Android for my participation in notGDCJam2019
